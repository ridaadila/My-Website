This place offers a really interesting and unique experience unlike other tourism places in Indonesia. In fact, this is the only submarine monument in Asia
                                                    . Located in Embong Kaliasin, Genteng, Surabaya. The submarine, named Pasopati 410 was made by the soviet union in 1952. The Submarine used to be a military Submarine used by the Indonesian navy. The submarine is involved in one of the infamous battle in Aru Sea against the dutch army to set free West Papua.
                                                    The monument offers not only a chance to see the huge submarine from the outside, but visitors can also take a look on what’s inside the submarine and experiencing the feeling of being inside a real submarine. Some of the tour guide was also a former crew of the submarine so they really know everything of the submarine itself.

                                                <h3>Klenteng Sanggar Agung</h3>
                                                <p>The Sanggar Agung temple is located in the tourist site of Ria Kenjeran Beach, Surabaya. Apart from being a place of worship for Tridarma followers, this temple is also very busy with tourists visiting.
